# Natural-Language-Processing-Unleashed-Decoding-WhatsApp-Chats-with-Python
WhatsApp Chat Analysis with Python: Uncover patterns, statistics, and insights from your conversations using NLP techniques and explore the dynamics of your chats through exploratory data analysis and time series analysis.

This comprehensive notebook demonstrates how to analyze WhatsApp conversations using Python.
The step-by-step process includes:

  * Step 1: Detecting {Date} and {Time} tokens
  * Step 2: Identifying the {Author} token
  * Step 3: Extracting and combining tokens
  * Step 4: Parsing the entire file and handling multi-line messages

> To gain further insights, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed:

  * Step 5: Conducting EDA to analyze chat data
  * Step 6: Obtaining overall statistics of the WhatsApp chat, such as the total number of messages, excluding media messages, and total number of URLs
  * Step 7: Extracting basic statistics for each author (user)
  * Step 8: Creating a word cloud to visualize the most frequently used words in the chat
  * Step 9: Calculating the total number of messages sent by each user
  * Step 10: Analyzing the distribution of messages sent on different days of the week
  * Step 11: Identifying the most active author in the chat
  * Step 12: Determining the most active day of the week

> In the subsequent steps, time series analysis is conducted on the chat data:

  * Step 13: Identifying periods of high chat activity
  * Step 14: Determining the specific dates when the chat was highly active
  * Step 15: Converting the time format from 12-hour to 24-hour for better analysis
  * Step 16: Determining the most favorable hour of the day for receiving a response from the user.
